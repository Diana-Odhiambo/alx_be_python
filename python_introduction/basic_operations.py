#Assignment of variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

#Performing Arithmetic operations.
Addition = number1 + number2
Subtraction = number1 - number2
Multiplication = number1 * number2

#Result
print("Addition of", number1, "and", number2, "is", Addition)
print("Subtraction of", number1, "and", number2, "is", Subtraction)
print("Multiplication of", number1, "and", number2, "is", Multiplication)
